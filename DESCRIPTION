Description: Allows for painless use of the 'Metopio' health atlas APIs
    <https://metopio.com/health-atlas> to explore and import data.
    'Metopio' health atlases store open public health data. See what topics
    (or indicators) are available among specific populations, periods, and
    geographic layers. Download relevant data along with geographic 
    boundaries or point datasets. Spatial datasets are returned as 'sf' 
    objects.
